The first project aims to find the approximate solution for the hydrodynamic system using the HLL solver and Rusanov flux, with 2 different types of boundary condition, Dirichlet condition and periodic condition

The second project aimes to simulate the dynamo of the sum, which is to simulate the dynamic period of the sun. Using 2D finite different method, centered and decentered derivative.
